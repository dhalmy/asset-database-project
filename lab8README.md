Some difficulties I ran into were the 'username' field I have in my employee entity. On the midterm you mentioned I would need to do some refactoring for this lab, which was correct.
It was conflicting with the Username from the User class.
I still want to keep username somehow, but right now all I have is a sort of band-aid fix where I renamed employee username to be 'auto_username'.
I want to figure out how to integrate the username I give to the employee to be the same username to sign into the webpage.
