My validateValidEmployee() function creates a valid employee John Doe with all correct information, then makes sure there's no violation.

    @Test
    public void validateValidEmployee(){}
<hr>
My validateInvalidFirstName() function sets John's name to John123 and since numbers aren't allowed in names, the function checks to make sure there was a violation.

    @Test
    public void validateInvalidFirstName(){}
<hr>
My validateInvalidUsername() function creates a test scenario where the username violates constraints, and then checks to ensure there is a violation.

    @Test
    public void validateInvalidUsername(){}
<hr>
My validateInvalidHireDate() function creates a test scenario with an invalid hire date (in the future), and checks to make sure there is a violation.

    @Test
    public void validateInvalidHireDate(){}
<hr>
